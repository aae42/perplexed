# Perplexed

This typeface is a very lightly modified derivative of IBM Plex Mono.

The only modifications made were to disable the `ccmp` tables, since
they were refusing to export properly, and to add the Powerline
glyphs for use in terminal applications.

As specified in the IBM Plex font release, this font is licensed under
the SIL Open Font License 1.1.  (see LICENSE.md)
