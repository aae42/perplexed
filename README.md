# Perplexed

This typeface is a very lightly modified derivative of IBM Plex Mono.

The only modifications made were to disable the `ccmp` tables, since
they were refusing to export properly, and to add the Powerline
glyphs for use in terminal applications.

**If you only want the font files, just download [PerplexedFamily.zip](https://github.com/phoikoi/perplexed/raw/master/PerplexedFamily.zip).**

If anybody more skilled than I would like to figure out how to re-enable
the `ccmp` tables (and explain it to me maybe?) I would be most grateful.
I'd like to have the font as close to the IBM original as possible,
with the addition of the Powerline characters.
